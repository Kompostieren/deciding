When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}

library(DiagrammeR)


mermaid("graph LR
        Y(Tradition)-->I(FArm); linkStyle 0 stroke:green, stroke-width:1.5px
        M(Cliche)-->I; linkStyle 1 stroke: green, stroke-width:1.5px
        I-->F(Woman in Agriculture); linkStyle 2 stroke: green, stroke-width:1.5px
        CL(Credibility)-->F; linkStyle 3 stroke: red, stroke-width:1.5px
        CM(Access)-->F; linkStyle 4 stroke: red, stroke-width:2.5px")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
